# Age Calculator
An age calculator is a simple age calculator tool that allows users to determine their age based on their date of birth. Try it live: https://age-calculator-kamaruddheens-projects.vercel.app/

## How it works
The age is calculated by getting the difference between the current date and the entered birth date.

To handle leap years, the actual number of days in each month is calculated based on the birth year. The age is broken down into years, months and days.
